# Running HalideOS on your System

### Dependencies



It is recommended that you used a Linux based operating system for building HalideOS. The C/C++ development
tools and ecosystem are much easier to use on a Linux based system.


* `g++` - a C++ compiler
* `nasm` or `as` - an x86 assembler
* `ld` - the GNU Linker
* `make` - GNU Make, a build tool for linux
* `qemu` - an x86 Emulator
* `git` - for version control
* A text editor of your choice, we use **VSCode**


You can google up how to install these tools for your host operating system. On linux based systems you will
mostly install them using your package manager.
