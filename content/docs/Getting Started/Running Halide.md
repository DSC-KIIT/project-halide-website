# Running HalideOS on your System

### Dependencies

It is recommended that you used a Linux based operating system for building HalideOS. The C/C++ development
tools and ecosystem are much easier to use on a Linux based system.

- `g++` - A C++ compiler
- `nasm` or `as` - An x86 assembler
- `ld` - The GNU Linker
- `make` - GNU Make, a build tool for linux
- `qemu` - An x86 Emulator
- `git` - For version control
- A text editor of your choice, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can google up how to install these tools for your host operating system. On linux based systems you will
mostly install them using your package manager.
