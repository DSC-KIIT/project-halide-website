# Running HalideOS on your System

### Dependencies

It is recommended that you used a Linux based operating system for building HalideOS. The C/C++ development
tools and the entire ecosystem is much easier to use on a Linux based system.

- `g++` - A C++ compiler
- `nasm` or `as` - An x86 assembler
- `ld` - The GNU Linker
- `make` - GNU Make, a build tool for Linux
- `qemu` - An x86 Emulator
- `git` - For version control
- A text editor of your choice, we use Visual Studio Code

You can Google up how to install these tools for your host operating system. On Linux based systems you will
mostly install them using your package manager.
