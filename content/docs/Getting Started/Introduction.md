# Introduction to Operating Systems Development

<center><h3>Please proceed with a <b>really good</b> grasp of C/C++</h3></center>

If you landed here then, congratulations! You are about to take on one of the most challenging projects in Software Engineering, that is, Operating System Developement. There are no proper roadmaps, no copy-paste code and lots of theory. You'll be guided solely by passion and you will truly peak once you dive into the depths of OS Dev.

You need to be able to undertand how hardware works, read and write assembly code to boot up your kernel and fairly good C/C++ code to add other features. It will require time, patience and careful code designs filled with abstractions.

If the prerequisites sound overwhelming, maybe this is not the right time for you to get into OS Dev. It's not a week long project that you can just be done with. It may takes months of work to take care of every possible test case for one typo, one loophole, will be enough to break your system. in short, this is an ongoing process.

Finally, this is not the guide to make the next Linux or Windows. This is a beginners guide based on our mistakes and learnings as we proceeded to make the experimental **Halide OS**.

### Motivation

### Rules and Goals

It is not okay to write average code thinking that the computer will take care of it
Have a plan. What exactly do you want your system to do? Reach for the stars and maybe you'll land on the moon.

- Kernel -

- Shell -

- GUI -

- Emulator -

### Essential tools

### Choose your Development Environment
