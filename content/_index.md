#  HalideOS - An Experimental OS from DSC KIIT

DSC KIIT is thrilled to open source **HalideOS**, our first experimental operating system written entirely 
from scratch.

* You can find the source code at [github.com/DSC-KIIT/project-halide](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/project-halide)
* Build and Install instructions are available [here](/docs/Getting-Started/Running-Halide/)

## About HalideOS

HalideOS is an experimental operating system written entirely from scratch, right from the kernel up to the user programs. It supports 
a basic shell with some commands including a command line calculator. You can boot it up and run it in a virtual machine.

It is a very **basic** and **bare bones** operating system totalling around 3,000 lines of code developed in a few weeks of time. The
main motive of this project was to demonstrate some basic principles and ideas of operating systems. Something small and understandable that
beginners can read and make sense out of.

The bulk of HalideOS is written using C++17 with some x86 assembly code for the bootloader. We have also implemented a very basic standard library
that developers can use to add commands to the shell.

Please refer the **Getting Started** and **Documentation** sections of the site to read more about the design and the code.

## Operating Systems Development

The modern operating systems we use are a marvel of computer science and software engineering. If you are someone 
who takes a keen interest in understanding how computers ultimately work, you will really enjoy learning about 
developing operating systems. 

Developing an operating system from scratch is one of the hardest tasks in computer science. It is considered a 
pinnacle of software engineering. It requires a good grasp of C/C++, x86 assembly language, processor architecture and memory. 
But it is not something that undergraduate students can't do as we learn all these subjects as a part of our coursework. 

This project is an attempt by DSC KIIT to introduce students to the fascinating domain of operating systems development.

## Get Involved

HalideOS is open sourced under the MIT License, feel free to contribute interesting features and improvements on the 
GitHub Repository.

KIIT students who want to learn more about this domain can reach out to us or the original project members on 
Twitter or Instagram.
