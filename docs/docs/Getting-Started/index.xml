      <description>Introduction to Operating Systems Development #  Please proceed with a really good grasp of C/C++If you landed here then, congratulations! You are about to take on one of the most challenging projects in Software Engineering, that is, Operating System Developement. There are no proper roadmaps, no copy-paste code and lots of theory. You&amp;rsquo;ll be guided solely by passion and you will truly peak once you dive into the depths of OS Dev.</description>

      <description>Running HalideOS on your System #  Dependencies #  It is recommended that you used a Linux based operating system for building HalideOS. The C/C++ development tools and the entire ecosystem is much easier to use on a Linux based system.
 g++ - A C++ compiler nasm or as - An x86 assembler ld - The GNU Linker make - GNU Make, a build tool for Linux qemu - An x86 Emulator git - For version control A text editor of your choice, we use Visual Studio Code  You can Google up how to install these tools for your host operating system.</description>
